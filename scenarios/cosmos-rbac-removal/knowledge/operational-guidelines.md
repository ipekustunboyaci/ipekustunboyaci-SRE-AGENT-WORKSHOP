# Operational Guidelines

## Infrastructure as Code — No Direct Changes

All infrastructure changes MUST go through code. Never modify Azure resources directly via CLI, portal, or API during incident remediation.

**When the SRE Agent identifies a fix:**

1. A human **creates or explicitly approves exactly one GitHub issue** describing
   the root cause, affected resources, and required Bicep change, then assigns
   it to `@copilot` (the Copilot coding agent).
2. Copilot authors the pull request; a human reviews and merges it.
3. That human manually triggers **Deploy Cosmos RBAC Removal Infrastructure**
   to apply the change (deployment is intentionally manual via
   `workflow_dispatch`, not automatic on merge).

**Do NOT:**
- Run `az` CLI commands to directly create, modify, or delete Azure resources
- Use the Azure portal to make manual changes
- Apply temporary fixes outside of version control
- Create branches or PRs yourself — delegate to `@copilot` via GitHub issues

**Why:** This team follows GitOps principles. All infrastructure state is defined in Bicep templates under `scenarios/cosmos-rbac-removal/infra/bicep/`. Direct changes create drift between code and reality, making future incidents harder to diagnose. Using GitHub issues with `@copilot` ensures full traceability from incident → issue → PR → deployment.

**Constrained manual fallback:** Only when the issue → Copilot PR → review →
merge → deployment path cannot be used, an authorized operator may use the
scenario-owned remediation script. It first verifies whether the matching
assignment already exists; it is not the normal remediation path and does not
replace the required Bicep correction.

## Architecture Overview

- **AKS cluster** (`srelabcosmos-aks`): Hosts the web app in the `cosmos-rbac-removal` namespace
- **CosmosDB** (`srelabcosmos-cosmos-{suffix}`): NoSQL database, accessed via workload identity (no connection strings)
- **Managed Identity** (`srelabcosmos-id`): UAMI with federated credential linked to K8s ServiceAccount `cosmos-rbac-removal-app`
- **Authentication chain**: Pod → K8s OIDC → Federated Credential → UAMI → CosmosDB RBAC role assignment

## Common Failure: CosmosDB RBAC

If the app returns HTTP 500 with "RBAC permissions" errors on `/items`:
- **Root cause**: The CosmosDB SQL role assignment for the UAMI is missing
- **Where to fix**: `scenarios/cosmos-rbac-removal/infra/bicep/modules/identity.bicep` — the `cosmosRoleAssignment` resource block
- **How to fix**: Create a GitHub issue with the title "Restore CosmosDB role assignment in identity.bicep" and assign it to `@copilot`
- **Do NOT** run `az cosmosdb sql role assignment create` directly
